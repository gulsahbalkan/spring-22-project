//Problem
How does the execution time change when problem size is increased? 
Report it by running the same algorithm for the given datasets.

//Answer
When (P = 4, Facility = 5, Point = 20) = Execution time is:4384800 nanoseconds.

When (P = 8, Facility = 10, Point = 50) = Execution time is:7799100 nanoseconds.

When (P = 12, Facility = 15, Point = 80) = Execution time is:9238000 nanoseconds.

When (P = 16, Facility = 20, Point = 110) = Execution time is:11672000 nanoseconds.

When (P = 20, Facility = 25, Point = 140) = Execution time is:12205700 nanoseconds.

//Conclusion
When the size of the problem increases, the execution time of our solution increases as well.
